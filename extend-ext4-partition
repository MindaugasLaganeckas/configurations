How to extend existing ext4 partition

    Resize the allocated partition. eg: cfdisk /dev/sda and select the option to resize the partition.
    The OS should update automatically, but just in case you can call partprobe /dev/sda
    Resize the file system. eg: for the ext file systems resize2fs /dev/sda1

As long as you are extending the partition (not shrinking) it should be safe to do this with the system running. But do backup everything.
